I completed the requirements. 
Media queries were wanted in the html vice on the style.css.
I learned how to code a navbar on the left and have a main article. I figured it out, but got stuck because I used the id, not the main. Rookie mistake. I'm glad it dawned on me. 
I embedded two videos from YouTube and linked two pictures.
I embedded an html piece to represent what the code was doing in one example. I didn't want to do it for each code example as it is tedious. Doing it once was plenty for this exercise. Perhaps I circle back around and do it later. 
I'm going to review Kevin Powell's flex box and grid info as I do have a grasp of using them, but I need to best understand when to use them. Today was box sizing and box model since it was a simple layout. 
I'm still using the example and looking up answers, which is good, for my development and learning process. I think I've two projects left and then I'm off to JS. I hope I grasp it this time. I think doing the coding each day will help versus just reading a lot about it.
