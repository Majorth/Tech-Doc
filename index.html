            <p>CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the 
                web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns. It 
                has many features that make building complex layouts 
                straightforward. This article will explain all you need to 
                know to get started with page layout.

            <header>What is grid layout?</header>
            <p>A grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating 
                a pattern against which we can line up our design elements. They 
                help us to create layouts in which our elements won't jump around 
                or change width as we move from page to page, providing greater 
                consistency on our websites.</p>
            <p>A grid will typically have columns, rows, and then gaps between 
                each row and column. The gaps are commonly referred to as gutters.

            <header>Creating your grid in CSS</header>
            <p>Having decided on the grid that your design needs, you can use CSS 
                Grid Layout to create it. We'll look at the basic features of Grid 
                Layout first and then explore how to create a simple grid system 
                for your project.
            </p>
            <header class="subheader">Defining a grid</header>
            <p>As a starting point, download and open the starting point file in 
                your text editor and browser (you can also see it live here). You 
                will see an example with a container, which has some child items. 
                These display in normal flow by default, so the boxes display one 
                below the other. We'll be working with this file for the first part 
                of this lesson, making changes to see how its grid behaves.
            </p>
            <p>To define a grid we use the grid value of the display property. As 
                with Flexbox, this enables Grid Layout; all of the direct children 
                of the container become grid items. Add this to the CSS inside your 
                file:
            </p>
            <code></code>
            <p>Unlike Flexbox, the items will not immediately look any different. 
                Declaring display: grid gives you a one column grid, so your items 
                will continue to display one below the other as they do in normal 
                flow.
            </p>
            <p>To see something that looks more grid-like, we'll need to add some 
            columns to the grid. Let's add three 200-pixel columns. You can use any 
            length unit or percentage to create these column tracks.
            </p>
            <code></code>
            <p>Add the second declaration to your CSS rule, then reload the page. You
             should see that the items have rearranged themselves such that there's 
             one in each cell of the grid.
            </p>
            <header class="subheader">Flexible grids with the <strong>fr</strong> unit</header>
            <p>In addition to creating grids using lengths and percentages, we can use 
                the fr unit to flexibly size grid rows and columns. This unit represents 
                one fraction of the available space in the grid container.
            </p>
            <p>Change your track listing to the following definition, creating three 
                1fr tracks.
            </p>
            <code></code>
            <p>You should now see that you have flexible tracks. The fr unit distributes 
            space proportionally. So if you specify different positive values for your 
            tracks like so:
            </p>
            <code></code>
            <p>The first track now gets 2fr of the available space and the other two tracks
                 get 1fr, making the first track larger. You can mix fr units with fixed 
                 length units â€” in such a case the space needed for the fixed tracks is 
                 used up first; the remaining space is then distributed to the other tracks.
            </p>
            <p class="note">Note: The fr unit distributes available space, not all space. 
                Therefore, if one of your tracks has something large inside it, there will be
                less free space to share.
            </p>
            <header class="subheader">Gaps between tracks</header>
            <p>To create gaps between tracks we use the properties column-gap for gaps between 
                columns, row-gap for gaps between rows, and gap as a shorthand for both.
            </p>
            <code></code>
            <p>These gaps can be any length unit or percentage, but not an fr unit.</p>
            <p class="note">Note: The gap properties (column-gap, row-gap and gap) used to be prefixed by 
                grid-, but this has been changed in the spec in order to make them usable in 
                multiple layout methods. The prefixed versions will be maintained as an alias, so 
                they'll be safe to use for some time. To be on the safe side, you could double up 
                and add both properties to make your code more bulletproof:
            </p>
